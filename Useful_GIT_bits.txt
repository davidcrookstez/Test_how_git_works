% Useful git information

To adjust the way line endings are committed

git config --global core.autocrlf true

There are 3 options:

Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings Git will convert LF to CRLF when checking out text files. When committing text files, CRLF will be converted to LF. For cross-platform projects, this is the recommended setting on Windows ("core.autocrlf" is set to "true")

Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings Git will not perform any conversion when checking out text files. When committing text files, CRLF will be converted to LF. For cross-platform projects this is the recommended setting on Unix ("core.autocrlf" is set to "input").

Checkout as-is, commit as-is Git will not perform any conversions when checking out or committing text files. Choosing this option is not recommended for cross-platform projects ("core.autocrlf" is set to "false")
